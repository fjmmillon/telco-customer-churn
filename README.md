You can find the data here: [Telco Customer Churn Prediction in Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn?datasetId=13996&sortBy=voteCount).

This repository is available in [Github](https://github.com/fjmmillon/telco-customer-churn) (better rendering of Jupyter Notebooks) and [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/fjmm-public-portfolio/data-analysis/telco-customer-churn-prediction).

Given this data, the goal is to build a model that can predict if a customer is going to churn or not.
